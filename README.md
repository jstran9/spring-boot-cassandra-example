# Spring Boot Cassandra Example

John Thompson's course can be seen here https://www.udemy.com/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/

As always I am making this repo to practice more with Git.

This repository will differ slightly as I had to make a few minor fixes to run on a newer version of Spring Boot.

# Different Files.
- guru.springframework.services.ProductServiceImpl
- guru.springframework.config.CassandraConfig
- guru.springframework.domain.Product
- guru.springframework.repositories.ProductRepositoryTest
